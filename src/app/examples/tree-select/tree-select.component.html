<!-- Basic
TreeSelect is used as a controlled component with ng-model directive along with an options collection. Internally Tree component is used so the options model is based on TreeNode API.
In single selection mode, value binding should be the key value of a node. -->
<p-treeselect class="md:w-80 w-full" containerStyleClass="w-full" [(ngModel)]="selectedNodes" [options]="nodes" placeholder="Select Item" />


<!-- Multiple
More than one node is selectable by setting selectionMode to multiple. By default in multiple selection mode, metaKey press (e.g. âŒ˜) is necessary to add to existing selections however this can be configured with disabling the metaKeySelection property. Note that in touch enabled devices, TreeSelect always ignores metaKey.
In multiple selection mode, value binding should be a key-value pair where key is the node key and value is a boolean to indicate selection. -->
<p-treeselect class="w-full md:w-80" containerStyleClass="w-full" [(ngModel)]="selectedNodes" [options]="nodes" [metaKeySelection]="false" selectionMode="multiple" placeholder="Select Item" />


<!-- Checkbox
Selection of multiple nodes via checkboxes is enabled by configuring selectionMode as checkbox. -->
<p-treeselect class="w-full md:w-80" containerStyleClass="w-full" [(ngModel)]="selectedNodes" [options]="nodes" display="chip" [metaKeySelection]="false" selectionMode="checkbox" placeholder="Select Item" />
